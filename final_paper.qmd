# Abstract

Fertility rates have been declining in many countries, often falling well below replacement level. While economic explanations dominate policy debates, cultural, attitudinal, and well-being factors may also play a key role in shaping childbearing behavior. This study examines four such factors — religiosity, heavy media use, traditional gender role attitudes, and well-being — using cross-national data from the World Values Survey (53 countries) and causal inference methods including propensity score weighting, Double Machine Learning (DoubleML), and sensitivity analysis.

Pooled results show that high religiosity (+0.40 pp) and traditional gender role attitudes (+0.14 pp) are associated with higher probabilities of having children, while heavy media use (–0.20 pp) is associated with lower fertility, and well-being has a modest positive effect (+0.06 pp). Country-level analyses reveal substantial heterogeneity, with certain effects concentrated in specific cultural or institutional contexts. Sensitivity analysis indicates that religiosity effects are most robust to unobserved confounding (~10% residual variance needed to nullify), while well-being effects are the least robust (~1%). These findings highlight the importance of considering cultural and attitudinal drivers alongside economic conditions in understanding fertility decline.

# Introduction

Global fertility decline has been one of the most significant demographic shifts of the past half-century. Many societies now face below-replacement fertility, raising concerns about aging populations, shrinking workforces, and the long-term sustainability of social systems. While much research has focused on economic factors — including income, urbanization, education, and labor market participation — cultural, attitudinal, and psychological factors also shape reproductive decisions.

Religiosity has long been linked to pro-natalist values. Media use may influence fertility by shaping perceptions of family life and economic constraints. Gender role attitudes affect how couples allocate time and resources toward family formation. Well-being may either encourage childbearing through optimism and life satisfaction, or reduce it if high satisfaction is achievable without children.

This study uses cross-national survey data and modern causal inference techniques to estimate the effects of these four factors on fertility, accounting for individual and national-level confounders. The goal is to provide a clearer understanding of the magnitude, robustness, and variability of these relationships across different social and cultural contexts.

# Literature Review

## Religiosity and Fertility

Frejka & Westoff (2006) find that religiosity is positively associated with fertility in both the U.S. and Europe, estimating that European fertility could rise by 13–14% if religiosity matched American levels. They show that both behavioral (church attendance) and attitudinal (importance of religion) measures predict fertility, even after adjusting for demographics. However, limited controls and single-item measures leave open the possibility of omitted variable bias and measurement error. Country groupings also mask heterogeneity, and development indicators such as GDP and urbanization were not fully incorporated.

## Media Use and Fertility

A 2023 study using the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) found that higher new media use (internet, mobile news) among women aged 20–49 is associated with lower fertility intentions, partly mediated by reduced social trust. Traditional media use showed no significant effect. The authors suggest that online environments amplify negative narratives about childbearing costs and institutional trust. While cross-sectional and not causally identified, this work points to a plausible pathway through which media exposure may influence fertility-related attitudes — one that may operate in other contexts as well.

## Gender Role Attitudes

Research shows that traditional gender role attitudes can correlate with higher fertility in contexts where policy and workplace norms are not strongly supportive of gender equality, while in more egalitarian settings, traditional norms may reduce fertility if they clash with prevailing work–family arrangements. Effects are therefore highly context-dependent.

## Well-being and Fertility

The relationship between well-being and fertility is theoretically ambiguous. Higher life satisfaction and optimism may encourage family formation, but high well-being without children may also reduce the perceived need for childbearing. Evidence from prior studies is mixed, with some finding positive associations and others showing no effect or even negative links in certain contexts.

## Methodology

To build on previous research, I use propensity score methods alongside DoubleML estimation to draw more credible causal conclusions about how religiosity and other social and attitudinal factors affect fertility patterns.

Variable Construction
The analysis begins with detailed variable engineering using survey items from the World Values Survey and supplemental World Bank indicators. Fertility is measured both as a binary indicator of whether the respondent has children and as a count variable capped at ten to mitigate outliers. Religiosity is constructed as a composite index combining standardized measures of the importance of religion, the importance of God, and religious service attendance. Individuals in the top third of the religiosity distribution are classified as high religiosity, and alternative cutoffs at 50 percent, 67 percent, and 75 percent are tested for robustness. Additional treatments are defined for heavy media use, traditional gender attitudes, and high well-being. Heavy media use captures daily use of at least two digital information sources. Traditional gender attitudes are measured using an index of inverted gender role items and dichotomized at the median. High well-being is based on a composite index of happiness, life satisfaction, freedom of choice, and financial satisfaction.

Confounders are selected dynamically based on the treatment variable to avoid post-treatment bias. For religiosity, this includes demographic, economic, and attitudinal covariates but excludes family or gender outcomes that may lie on the causal pathway. For other treatments, the relevant confounder set is adjusted accordingly. National-level controls for GDP per capita, urban population share, life expectancy, and population size are included in pooled analyses but excluded in country-level models. Countries are retained only if they have at least 1,200 respondents and sufficient variation in the treatment variable to allow meaningful comparisons.

Propensity Score
Propensity scores are estimated using logistic regression on the treatment-specific confounder set. Observations are restricted to complete cases for the relevant variables. Overlap between treatment and control groups is assessed through density plots and the common support range is reported to ensure that comparisons are made only within comparable subpopulations. In country-level analyses, observations outside the common support range are dropped before estimation.

DoubleML Estimation
I use Double Machine Learning to estimate the average treatment effect. This approach is doubly robust, providing consistent estimates if either the treatment model or the outcome model is correctly specified. Cross-fitting is used to reduce overfitting. Linear regression is applied for the outcome model and logistic regression for treatment assignment. The method is implemented in both pooled and country-specific datasets to capture heterogeneity across contexts.

Cross-National Comparisons
The analysis is replicated for each country that meets the sample size and variation thresholds. For each country, results include sample size, treatment rate, fertility rate, estimated effect size, confidence intervals, common support range, and whether the effect is statistically significant.

Sensitivity Analysis
To evaluate robustness to unmeasured confounding, I use the sensemakr framework in R. This method reports the partial R-squared of the treatment, robustness values for q = 1, and robustness values for q = 1 at the 0.05 significance level. A benchmark covariate, marital status, is used to contextualize the magnitude of robustness values. Sensitivity analyses are conducted separately for religiosity, media use, gender attitudes, and well-being as treatments, in both pooled and country-level datasets.

## Data

Individual-level data come from the World Values Survey (Wave 7) covering 53 countries. National-level indicators (GDP per capita PPP, urbanization, life expectancy, population size) are merged from World Bank data.

## Estimation Strategy

1. **Propensity Score Weighting** — Logistic regression predicts treatment status from demographic, economic, and attitudinal covariates, excluding post-treatment variables. Overlap is checked via density plots to ensure common support.
2. **DoubleML** — Cross-fitting with linear models (outcome) and logistic regression (treatment) to estimate the average treatment effect (ATE), adjusting for both individual and country-level covariates.
3. **Sensitivity Analysis** — Using `sensemakr` to quantify robustness to unobserved confounding, reporting partial \( R^2 \) and robustness values (RV).

# Discussion

The pooled analysis shows clear contrasts across treatments:

- **Religiosity** has the strongest and most robust positive association with fertility, suggesting a consistent pro-natalist influence across contexts.
- **Media Use** shows a robust negative association, echoing the CGSS finding for China and suggesting that high digital media consumption may lower fertility by amplifying narratives that discourage childbearing.
- **Traditional Gender Role Attitudes** are associated with higher fertility in some contexts but negative in others, underscoring the role of institutional fit between norms and work–family policy.
- **Well-being** shows a small positive pooled effect but is highly context-dependent, with significant negative effects in Turkey and Pakistan.

Sensitivity analysis reveals that religiosity is most robust to unobserved confounding, followed by media use, gender roles, and well-being.

# Limitations

- Observational, cross-sectional data cannot confirm temporal ordering or fully eliminate confounding.
- Measurement limitations: single-item or short-scale measures for some constructs; media use measure lacks content specificity.
- Smaller samples in some countries reduce power for detecting effects.
- Country-level heterogeneity suggests unmeasured institutional or policy factors interact with individual attitudes.

# Conclusion

Cultural, attitudinal, and well-being factors contribute to fertility behavior in ways that vary by context. Religiosity and traditional gender role attitudes generally promote higher fertility, while heavy media use is associated with lower fertility, and well-being shows mixed effects. Policymakers aiming to address fertility decline should consider how cultural values and information environments interact with economic and institutional conditions. Further research should integrate richer measures, longitudinal data, and causal identification strategies to better understand these relationships.
